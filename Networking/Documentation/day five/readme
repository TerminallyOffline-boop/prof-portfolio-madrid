Skipped Day 4 because of piling school works, but this day 5 is the continuation of day three which tackles the Speed and Duplex of a network. 
After review I gained insights on manually setting speed of each nodes, the concept of Hubs and Autonegotiation and Collisions and why they happen.
I also learned Full, half duplex and Auto.
