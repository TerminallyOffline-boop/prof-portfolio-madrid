Day one covers my review of LAN switching.
This covers the topics of MAC Addresses, ARP and VLAN
Documentation shows the MAC address table shown dynamically within the switch command line interface.
It also show ARP and its messages such as ARP request and Arp reply, also the concepts of Unknown Unicast Frame and Known Unicast Frame
And finally VLANS and how to create a smaller LAN inside a LAN connection
